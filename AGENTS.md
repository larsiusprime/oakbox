# Guidance for coding agents (OAK box)

OAK box is a desktop app, and **most of its users are on Windows**. Develop and test on Linux, but write for
Windows first. SPEC.md is the product spec: keep it in step with what's built.

## Windows: text is always UTF-8 (non-negotiable)

Windows Python reads and writes text in the system code page (cp1252, "charmap") unless told otherwise. A "−", "é",
"²" or "✓" then stops a run on Windows that passes everywhere else (`UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't
encode character…`). Every time you touch I/O:

- **Every text read and write says `encoding="utf-8"`:** `open()`, `Path.read_text()` / `write_text()` / `.open()`,
  `importlib.resources` `read_text()`, `io.TextIOWrapper`, text-mode temp files, `subprocess` with `text=True`
  (also give `errors="replace"` when reading another program's output). Never rely on the default.
  `tests/test_encoding.py` fails on any that doesn't.
- **CSVs and other files the user brings** may not be UTF-8 (Excel writes cp1252, sometimes with a BOM). Read them
  as their files are, never as the computer's default; `utf-8-sig` drops a BOM.
- **Every Python process OAK box starts runs in UTF-8 mode** (`-X utf8`, `PYTHONUTF8=1`, `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`:
  `bring_in.child_env()`), so OpenAVMKit's own reads, writes and prints are UTF-8 too. The launchers
  (`Oakbox.cmd`, `oakbox.sh`, `run.bat`) start it with `-X utf8`. A new launcher or subprocess does the same.
- **Printing:** `pythonw` has no console (`sys.stdout` is `None`); a console may not be UTF-8. The app reconfigures
  its streams to UTF-8; don't print where it can fail a run.
- **Also Windows:** paths with spaces and non-ASCII letters (`C:\Users\José\Documents\OAK box`), `\` separators
  (use `pathlib`, never string paths), a file open in Excel can't be replaced (say so, don't crash), names are
  case-insensitive, `os.rename` onto an existing file fails (use `os.replace`), CRLF line endings in files users
  bring.
- **Check it:** CI runs the whole suite a second time with a non-UTF-8 default encoding (ASCII, stricter than
  cp1252). Do the same before pushing:
  `PYTHONUTF8=0 PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE=0 LC_ALL=C LANG=C uv run pytest -q tests`

## Engine or app?

OAK box is a front end to OpenAVMKit, and the engine is ours to change (the fork's branch, pinned in
`pyproject.toml`, then upstream). Anything generally useful (a check, a statistic, a file of results, progress)
is built in the engine, so notebook users get it too, without changing what the engine already does by default
(a new setting, off unless asked for). OAK box keeps what only an app needs: screens, wording, the user's
choices turned into settings.

## Screens

- **Width:** tables, charts and other non-text elements use all the width available (a minimum width is fine,
  never a maximum). Only running text is capped for readability (`.project p`, `.cs-text`, `.wiz-lede`…).
- **Tables:** every table has faint cell lines and alternate gray rows (the `:where(table)` rules at the end of
  `styles.css`); a numbers column's header has the column's class (`th.cs-n`) so it lines up with its numbers.
  A chart is drawn at its own width in pixels (a `ResizeObserver`), not scaled, so its text stays its size.
- **Short labels, the rest on demand:** a table cell says a short phrase; the fuller explanation goes in a tooltip
  (`components/Tip.tsx`: `InfoTip` shows an ⓘ beside the phrase), not in the cell. A column's header isn't repeated
  in its cells ("Pattern" over "Low price", not "Pattern 2: low price").

## Going online

- Downloads check certificates as the computer does: every process OAK box starts calls
  `oakbox.net.use_system_certificates()` first (a new entry point does too).
- Say who's asking: `oakbox.net.USER_AGENT`. Public services are shared (OpenStreetMap's Overpass is run by
  volunteers): keep rate limits on, cache and reuse, never retry in a loop, and send nothing to a service that
  didn't answer. Credit data as its licence asks ("© OpenStreetMap contributors", ODbL).

## Before pushing: what CI runs

Run all of it, not only the tests; CI fails on any of these.

```sh
uv run ruff check src tests && uv run ruff format --check src tests && uv run pyright && uv run pytest -q tests
PYTHONUTF8=0 PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE=0 LC_ALL=C LANG=C uv run pytest -q tests
(cd web && npx biome check src && npx eslint src && npx tsc --noEmit)
# API types: regenerate and check nothing changed
uv run python -c "import json; from oakbox.app import create_app; print(json.dumps(create_app().openapi(), indent=1))" > web/openapi.json
(cd web && npm run -s api) && git diff --exit-code web/openapi.json web/src/api/schema.d.ts
```

A change to what the user sees is also checked in the real app (`run.bat`, or `uv run python -X utf8 -m oakbox`),
not only by tests.
